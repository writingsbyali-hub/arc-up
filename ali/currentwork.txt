working with the UI/UX agents to fix typography, here is the list of tasks:
Top Critical Issues
1. Typography "Zoomed In" Feeling (Highest Impact)
Get Started page: Body text is text-2xl/3xl (should be text-base/lg)
About page: Body text is text-3xl/4xl (should be text-xl/2xl)
Impact: Users feel uncomfortable, pages look like presentation decks
2. Broken Workspace (Blocks Primary Use Case)
Primary CTA leads to "Coming Soon" page
No alternative way to access research protocols
Damages credibility
3. Get Started Page Overwhelm (High Bounce Rate)
7+ decision points on one page
Too long (559 lines)
Decision fatigue
4. Missing Accessibility Features
No lang="en" attribute
Missing focus states on ~40% of links
Inconsistent breadcrumbs
404 page not branded
5. Design System Gaps
No unified spacing system
Inconsistent button styling
No typography documentation

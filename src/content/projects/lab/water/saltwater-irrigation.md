## The Challenge

Saline encroachment threatens food security globally. Rising sea levels and poor irrigation practices increase soil salinity, rendering agricultural land unusable. Coastal communities face a difficult choice: invest in expensive desalination infrastructure or abandon productive farmland altogether.

Current approaches to managing soil salinity—such as leaching, gypsum amendment, or phytoremediation—are often costly, time-intensive, or have limited effectiveness in highly saline conditions. Meanwhile, climate change accelerates the problem, pushing saline water further inland and increasing the urgency for novel, scalable solutions.

Can plasma-activated water offer a pathway to salinity-tolerant cultivation? This project explores whether treating saline irrigation water with atmospheric plasma can reduce its harmful effects on plants and potentially accelerate soil remediation.

## Our Approach

We're testing whether plasma-activated saltwater (PAW) can support crop growth where conventional saline water cannot. Our approach combines laboratory analysis, greenhouse trials, and field testing to understand:

1. **Plasma chemistry effects:** How do reactive species generated by plasma alter the chemical composition of saline water?
2. **Plant tolerance:** Which crop species and cultivars show resilience when irrigated with PAW-treated saltwater?
3. **Soil dynamics:** Does PAW influence soil salinity levels over time through remediation mechanisms?

This is a systematic, multi-phase investigation designed to produce reproducible protocols that other researchers and farming communities can validate and build upon.

## Research Questions

1. Can plasma activation of saline water reduce its harmful effects on plant growth?
2. Which crop species and cultivars show tolerance to PAW-treated saltwater irrigation?
3. Does PAW application influence soil salinity levels over time through remediation mechanisms?
4. What are the optimal plasma treatment parameters for different salinity levels?
5. How do PAW treatments compare to conventional approaches (leaching, gypsum amendment, phytoremediation)?

## Current Status

**Literature review phase.** We're currently conducting a comprehensive review of:
- Salinity tolerance mechanisms in plants
- Plasma agriculture applications and reactive species chemistry
- Existing soil remediation techniques and their efficacy

**Seeking partners** with agronomy expertise, access to test plots or greenhouses, and connections to communities facing salinity challenges.

**Next steps:**
- Finalize research questions and experimental design
- Identify field partners and test sites
- Set up initial greenhouse trials with selected crop species

## Timeline

**Phase 1: Foundation (End of 2025)**
- Finalize research questions
- Identify field partners
- Complete literature review on salinity tolerance mechanisms and plasma agriculture applications

**Phase 2: Field Trials (Mid 2026)**
- Set up first field trials with selected crop species
- Deploy monitoring systems for soil salinity and moisture
- Begin systematic data collection

**Phase 3: Analysis & Documentation (End of 2026)**
- Analyze initial results
- Document protocols for replication
- Publish interim findings under open licenses
- Iterate based on learnings
